# Introduction
This is my pet-project directed to learn such technologies, as:
- Protocol Buffers
- Some parts of Spring (BeanPostProcessor, AOP, etc.)
- NoSQL (Redis, Neo4j)
- Spring Cloud
- Tests (testcontainers)

# What and when to use
- Protocol Buffers fox advanced serialization/deserialization speed, solve problem with Java native mechanism
- Redis, as says Chat GPT, for caching (i think in sessions, but not sure) (update 2: Chat GPT suggest to use it in real-time notification system)
- Neo4j for recommendation system
- Spring Cloud just for fun, it's my 4 time to use it
